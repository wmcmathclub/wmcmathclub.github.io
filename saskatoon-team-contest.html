        <p>Walter Murray's Math Club is proud to be hosting Saskatoon's first ever YXE Team Math Contest! This is a competition available to all elementary and high school students who currently attend a Saskatoon school. You and your team will be put to a test of wits against the other teams in an attempt to prove yourselves as the best in Saskatoon. Cash prizes will be available for the winners.</p>

                <p class="expandable" id="participation-info">Any elementary school or high school student in Saskatoon is eligible to participate in this contest. It does not matter if you are in the public system or catholic system. Please note, however, that some of the problems will contain high school level mathematics and mathematical concepts, and will therefore not be suitable to most elementary school students.</p>

                    <p>The contest will take place the entire day.</p>
                    <p>There are three rounds in the contest. First is the individual round, where each competitor individually works on a set of 10 problems. The team's score is the sum of each competitors score. Next is the team round, where you work with all of your team to solve 20 problems. Finally, there is the relay round. In the relay round, teams organize themselves into a row. Each person's answer depends upon the previous person's answer. In addition to the competition, there will also be a talk given by a professor from the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
