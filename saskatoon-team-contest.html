        <p>Walter Murray's Math Club is proud to be hosting Saskatoon's first ever YXE Team Math Contest! This is a competition available to all elementary and high school students who currently attend a Saskatoon school. You and your team of 4 will be put to a test of wits against the other teams in an attempt to prove yourselves as the best in Saskatoon. Prizes will be available for the winners. If you do not yet have a team, you can sign up as an individual and you will be assigned a team on the day of the contest.</p>

It does not matter if you are in the public system or catholic system. Please note, however, that some of the problems will contain high school level mathematics and mathematical concepts, and will therefore not be suitable to most elementary school students.</p>

                    <p>If you've never written a math contest before, the problems will be different than the type of math you are used to seeing in school. These problems will need outside-the-box thinking, using the math you have learned in school to tackle problems you've never seen before. Here is an example of such a problem:</p>
                    <p class="quote">There are 100 lockers in a row, all closed. You make 100 passes: on the first pass, you toggle every locker. On the second pass, you toggle every 2nd locker. On the third pass, every 3rd locker… and so on, until the 100th pass, when you toggle only the 100th locker. How many lockers are open at the end?</p>

We will try to pair up people from the same school as much as possible.</p>
